mytext=<p align='justify'><b>WORK</b>
Cobane offers a design and manufacturing service, one to one with clients to design all manner of buildings, house extensions and interior and exterior woodwork, including bespoke hand made kitchens and fine pieces of furniture.
We apply the time honoured traditions of green oak framed construction and woodworking skills to all that we manufacture.
We have a portfolio of existing work of architectural interiors and exteriors and of choice pieces, produced for clients, which will help you make decisions about what you want. Our portfolio ranges in diversity from sympathetic designs, in keeping with existing features, to more avant garde approaches.
We have experience of working within the constraints of listed buildings and are able to produce conceptual designs that will marry with existing traditions. We have the skills needed to carry out conservation work on period pieces. By consulting with engineers and architects as well as employing the help of NHBC registered builders, we can undertake projects of any scale or level of complexity.
We offer an initial consultation service, a bespoke design service and thereafter written quoted for all enquiries. We aim to please, and therefore conduct all work with the utmost professionalism, consulting and liaising with clients and project managers, throughout the whole project.
