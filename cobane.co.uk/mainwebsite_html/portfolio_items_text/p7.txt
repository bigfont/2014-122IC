Fern Owls</b><br>Haselmere, Sussex, 2003.
A house extension and remodelling project with added new build garage and lantern tower. The garage was integrated with the existing house structure by a %60link roof%B4. This was an architect led project where I designed, build and installed the structural oak frame, ballustrading, the garage frame and lantern tower.
 • Garage with Lantern Tower
 • Porch with Link Roof
 • Balcony %26 Dining Room Bay
 • Pergola
 • Gates
A pergola produced in green oak supported on brick and local handmade clay creasings. The design was inspired by the simplicity of the arts and crafts movement. The clean lines and strong structures echo those of the dwelling house itself.
