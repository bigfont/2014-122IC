All Saints Church</b><br>Near Doncaster, South Yorkshire 1998
A private contract where I was employed to design, build and install all the structural and decorative joinery work involved in this project. The Church was redesigned to become a private dwelling and to include a first floor level and floor levels in the bell tower.
The project was featured in Interior Design magazines and on two terrestrial Television programmes.
Photographs
 · Details of the Gothic Arched doors and panels which were produced as room partitions. They were designed to compliment the neo gothic architecture of the building. These arches continued in the ballustrading and staircases.
 · A four poster bed produced in situ for the first floor sleeping area. Designed as a main feature of this area.
